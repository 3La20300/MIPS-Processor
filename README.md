# MIPS-Processor
The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor is a widely used RISC architecture known for its simplicity and efficiency. Featuring a fixed instruction length and a large number of general-purpose registers, MIPS processors excel in high-performance computing tasks like digital signal processing and networking.
